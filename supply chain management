📦 Supply Chain Management in Agriculture – SE Project
This Software Engineering project focuses on building a digital solution for Supply Chain Management (SCM) in Agriculture, aiming to improve transparency, efficiency, and communication among all stakeholders in the agricultural ecosystem.

🌾 Project Overview:
The agriculture supply chain involves multiple stages—from farmers and suppliers to distributors, retailers, and consumers. Manual and traditional supply chain systems often face challenges like lack of transparency, delays, miscommunication, and wastage. This project addresses these issues by introducing a software-based system to manage and streamline the agricultural supply chain process.

🔧 Key Features:
Farmer Dashboard: Allows farmers to register, list crops, update availability, and view current market demands.

Distributor Module: Enables distributors to browse available produce, place orders, and coordinate logistics.

Inventory Management: Tracks stock levels, harvest status, and transportation data.

Order & Delivery Tracking: Facilitates real-time status updates from dispatch to delivery.

Secure Login System: Role-based access for farmers, distributors, admins, and other stakeholders.

Reports & Analytics: Generates supply-demand analytics and performance reports for decision-making.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Java / Python / PHP (based on your actual implementation)

Database: MySQL / Firebase (based on your setup)

Tools: XAMPP, GitHub, Google Drive for documentation and collaboration

✅ Objectives Achieved:
Reduced manual dependency in agricultural logistics

Improved coordination between farmers and supply chain partners

Enhanced transparency and traceability in produce flow

Promoted better price discovery and reduced wastage
